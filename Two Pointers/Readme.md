## Two pointers
1. Converging Patterns
    keep one pointer at starting and other at last and then move depending upon comparisons
    ex: palindrome check

2. Parallel Pointers
    In this both pointers start fron the same position and move in the same direction
    ex: use in sliding window, generate subarrays

3. Trigger Based pointers
    In starting keep both pointer at start and move only one pointer and when we find info then move left pointer to find additonal info related to found on 1st pointer,
    ex: finding the nth node from the end of the linkedlist

# When to use Two Pointers
it is generally use in arrays,strings,linkedlist if data is in predicted pattern like sorted array or palindrome string or in finding pair of values
